      <h1>Here’s to a lifetime together</h1>
      <p>
        What? It’s barely a week into our relationship and you’re asking me to be your wife? Who does that?”. This was Annie’s response after I first asked her to marry me, barely a week into our relationship. It Started in January 2020. I was in a Postgraduate school, working on my clinical residency in Ukraine. Just like any man ready to settle down would do, I began the search for my missing rib. I remember discussing my intentions with my cousin who told me in her words "Relax, I know what you want and the exact kind of person that matches your taste and personality". To be honest, I was curious to see how well she knew me.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>     Two weeks later, I got a call from the said cousin about her friend’s sister, Annie, whom she thought I might like. It was January 8th, Annie’s birthday, and her sister who is a friend with my cousin had posted Annie’s picture on Facebook, to wish her a happy birthday. My cousin forwarded her pictures to me. Seeing her beautiful pictures for the first time, I instantly knew I wanted to get to know her and possibly meet her.</p>

      <!-- <h1>The Journey To Forever</h1> -->
      <p>
         At the time, Annie was a final-year nursing student, based in New York. My cousin reached out to her friend, who was Annie’s sister, to request her contact. Annie had told her sister she wasn’t interested and didn’t want her sister to share her contact with me. I persisted and on February 9th, almost a month later, Annie finally agreed, and her sister shared her phone number with me.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> My cousin had given me what she considered a “pep talk” on how to approach Annie. I had also asked my brother how to go about it and he said, “Don’t worry, the Holy Spirit will guide you”. There and then, I knew I was on my own.  On February 10th, I finally broke the ice and chatted her up and she responded. We chose a time that was convenient for both of us due to the time difference. I had to answer ten questions in one sentence during the first call lol. </p>

           From our numerous calls and chats, we got to know each other and learned more about each other on a deeper level. We found that we had a lot in common and the connection was undeniable. Annie was a nursing student working on her Capstone course before graduation and I was wrapping up my Residency Program. Our conversations were mentally stimulating, and we talked about everything and nothing without getting bored. We found ourselves spending hours on WhatsApp video calls talking laughing and enjoying each other’s company.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>  During our conversation, I told Annie I wanted her to be my wife. Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, that didn't go well, I might have been a little too forward. Annie’s response was “What? It’s barely a week into our relationship and you’re asking me to be your wife? Who does that?”.  I spent a few days trying to remedy that situation, I was lucky she even answered my call after that. Deep down, I knew I had messed up and I also knew she’ll someday be my wife.</p>

                Time past, I got another chance and we started on a clean slate. We found ourselves slowly falling in love with each other each passing day. We made plans to meet after her graduation, but then the Pandemic hit, and we couldn’t travel. We finally met the following year, in February 2021 in Abuja, Nigeria, to celebrate my birthday. The moment I saw Annie for the first time, I knew she was the woman for me. Annie is loving, kind, funny, and easy-going. The love and connection was strong, her smile was contagious, and it felt like we’d known each other for decades. She is the missing rib I was searching for, she is my better half, the love of my life.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>    Fast forward to October 2021, I asked her to be my wife yet again, and this time, she said YES. It was one of the best days of my life. Here’s to a lifetime together.</p>
